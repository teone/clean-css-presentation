##  My Way

#### Read Good practice

- Define as much plain object as you can (like SMACSS Base Section, eg: `.header`)
- Define as much global modifier as possible (from OOCSS separation, eg: `.text-center`)
- Define few descentant modifier inside an element (from BEM, eg: `.header > .blockquote`)
- Avoid to use **Element** selector (eg: `div`) except for Base Section (eg: `h1`)
- USE SASS (there's a lot more than variables)
