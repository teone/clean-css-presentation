**[Object Oriented CSS]**

#### Basic Principles
- **Separate structure and skin:** _this means to define repeated visual feature (eg: border) as separate skin. In this way you can reuse and combine them._
- **Separate container and content:** _Essentially, this means “rarely use location-dependent styles”._
